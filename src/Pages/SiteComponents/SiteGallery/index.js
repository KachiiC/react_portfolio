    description: "This properties of both combines the carousel and the modal. The gallery consists of a selected image (which by default is the first image from the query) and a carousel of images that match the query. The image carousel is fairly similar to the previous component, but now when you click on the image, react hooks takes the imageâ€™s index and displays the same image as the large selected image. To further view the image, the image can be displayed similar to the modal component when clicked."
