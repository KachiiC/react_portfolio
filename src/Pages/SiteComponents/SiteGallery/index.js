            This properties of both combines the carousel and the modal. The gallery 
            consists of a selected image (which by default is the first image from the query) 
            and a carousel of images that match the query. The image carousel is fairly similar  
            to the previous component, but now when you click on the image, react hooks takes 
            the imageâ€™s index and displays the same image as the large selected image. To 
            further view the image, the image can be displayed similar to the modal component 
            when clicked.
