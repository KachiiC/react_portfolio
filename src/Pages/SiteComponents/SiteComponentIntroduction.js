        <p>The Great thing about react is the the fact you can create components and
            reuse them whenever you want. Although libraries such as react-bootstrap, 
            material-ui and ant design can be used when making quick projects. I've also 
            taken time to learn how to make my own components just in case those libraries
            don't have exactly for I'm looking for.
