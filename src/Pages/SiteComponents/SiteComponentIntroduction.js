        <p>The Great thing about react is the the fact you can create components and
            reuse them whenever you want. Although I do often use libraries such as 
            react-bootstrap, material-ui and ant design can be used when making quick 
            projects. I've also taken time to learn how to make my own components just 
            in case.
