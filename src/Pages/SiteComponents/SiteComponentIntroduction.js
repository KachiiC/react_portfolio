        <p>Using just HTML, CSS and JS is fine if you are making an app that will never change. 
            However, modern apps constantly update its content and limiting yourself to HTML, CSS 
            and JS would mean a developer will have need hard code any changes every time they want 
            to make a change.

            The Great thing about react is the the fact you can create components and
            reuse them whenever you want. Although libraries such as react-bootstrap, 
            material-ui and ant design can be used when making quick projects. I've also 
            taken time to learn how to make my own components just in case those libraries
            don't have exactly for I'm looking for.
