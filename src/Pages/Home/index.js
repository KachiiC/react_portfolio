            You’d have got long odds on such a result at half-time, so one-sided were the opening 45 minutes. However, Liverpool failed to build on Sadio Mane’s opener, losing their way badly after the break, and Semi Ajayi’s towering late header sent the Baggies home happy.
            Allardyce has now avoided defeat on each of his last four visits here, each of them with different clubs. He remains the last visiting manager to win at Anfield in the league, doing so with Crystal Palace in April 2017.
            This, to be honest, was a bigger achievement. There looked to be no chance for Albion as Liverpool dominated the first half but Allardyce’s plan to pilfer a point came to fruition as the game wore on. They’ll feel they deserved their reward. In truth, from inside the stadium it felt like it was coming.
            Klopp’s side, who had seen Manchester United and Leicester and Chelsea stumble on Boxing Day, can have no complaints after squandering two points themselves. They are not used to performances like this. Not at home, not against such limited opposition.
