                React is so a great framework for dynamically displaying data, the best part is, 
                the data doesnâ€™t even have to be yours! There are several services online which 
                specialise in providing data. Once you are familiarised with JSON and a type of 
                API request then you can start making all types of projects or components for
                your website!
