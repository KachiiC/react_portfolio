            <p>As a developer, you may find it time consuming to write data and ensuring that data is
                always up to date. Rapid Api is a platform which offers a number of APIs available  
                to its users, most of the apis are free to use (up to a limit). If you are looking to
                practice using API's then registering with Rapid Api is the perfect starting point.

                Here are some projects that I've created with this API. An IMDB project where you can 
                search for shows and movies and a weather project where you can check the weather forecast
                of any city!
